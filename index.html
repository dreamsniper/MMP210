                <p>I was born in NYC and raised in the Bronx. Art is something that has brought me focus and direction in my life. I honed my fine arts skills at LaGuardia High School of Music and art.

                I went on to study Graphic design at Katherine Gibbs where I earned my degree in Visual Communications. I learned the use of many programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator I gained a good understanding of how to utilize various art programs and delved a little into web design.I currently work at GIA (The Gemological Institute of America) the worlds foremost authority in Gems and Gemology. I continue to develop my skills in Multimedia Programming at Borough of Manhattan Community College</p>
